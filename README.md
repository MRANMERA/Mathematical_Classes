# Mathematical Classes and Probability Distributions in Python

## Object-Oriented Programming and Classes in Python

### Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and programs. Each object is an instance of a class, which defines a blueprint for creating objects with specific properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and efficient problem-solving by organizing code into manageable and reusable components.

#### Benefits of OOP in Python:
- **Modularity**: Encapsulation allows hiding the complexity of implementation.
- **Reusability**: Classes and objects can be reused in different parts of the program.
- **Flexibility**: Easily modify and update existing code without affecting other parts of the program.
- **Scalability**: Allows building large and complex applications more effectively.
- **Maintenance**: Simplifies maintenance by dividing the code into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Mathematical Classes Implemented

# 1.) Fraction Class

## Concept

The `Fraction` class represents fractions with a numerator (`n`) and denominator (`d`). It provides methods for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions.

## Example

```python
x = Fraction(6, 7)
y = Fraction(2, 3)
print(x + y)  # Output: 32/21


### ComplexNumber Class

```markdown
# ComplexNumber Class

## Concept

The `ComplexNumber` class models complex numbers (`a + bi`) with real (`real`) and imaginary (`imag`) parts. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Example

```python
c1 = ComplexNumber(2, 3)
c2 = ComplexNumber(1, 4)
print(c1 + c2)  # Output: 3 + 7i
